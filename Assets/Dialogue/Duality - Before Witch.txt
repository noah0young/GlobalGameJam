W Okay, my sweet lil’ lilies are done! It took awhile, but I think y’all could last up to a couple more weeks if that annoying twat doesn’t return—
M Stop it right there, you hag!
W And, you’re back. Again. Wonderful.
P Is that sarcasm?
M Of course, it is, you dolt. 
W Hm, so it seems that the spell sort of worked.
M I don’t what you were thinking in merging two beings together, but now it’s time to take you down!
W Merge? I didn’t perform an amalgamation spell.
P What? Then, what did you do to us and why?
W I wanted to kill you. But, like psychologically? You’ll just come back to life after a couple of tries anyway, but you know mental damage.
M I don’t understand.
W Ugh! I tried to split your core. Yin and yang? The concept of dualism? I tried to server your core traits in order for you to see yourself as the enemy and to leave me the hell alone. It looks like I failed since you are back here again!
P We have been here more than once…
W Several times, actually! You are so desperate in becoming the hero in a town that only considers who a monster! You are more of a nuisance than me, and I am supposed to be the rotten damned witch. <size=10>You turn an entire town to stone for garden decor, and now you’re the bad guy for centuries.</size>
P So, we are the same person. 
M I can’t believe it.
W Well, believe it, tulip. And, now it’s time to be trampled. Again, okay?
