W Fufufu, so you actually defeated me for once. 
W AND AGAIN RUIN MY DARLING LILIES!
M Heh, turn us back to normal, you fiend, before we cut off your head!
P No, split us up permanently! There should be a way to give us both autonomy, right?
M Wait, what are you doing?
P Freeing the “true us” that had the burden of me existing. I’m dragging us back. You have the drive and potential to become a real hero while I’m not really qualified for that.
M The hell?! That’s not true!
P Liar! You said it yourself that I’m useless!
M But, I…
M I didn’t mean that! I need you, okay? You hear that!
M I need you. We need each other. Without you, I would be reckless and get us killed. You have the better attitude and patience in being a hero… 
P Seriously?
M Don’t make me repeat myself!
W Aw, this is adorable, touching even. Y’all could’ve made me cry if I gave a damn.
P How are you still able to move? 
W Huh? I’m immortal, you idiot! I’ve been telling y’all this EVERY SINGLE TIME!
P Oh.
M Damnit.
P So…
W So, do you know what I’m going to do? 
P Merge us back properly…
M Since we learned a proper lesson on self-love or whatever…
W I’m gonna kick y’all off of my damned mountain. AGAIN. OKAY?
B … 
B Okay.
