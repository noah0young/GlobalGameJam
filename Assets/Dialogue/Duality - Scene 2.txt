P We should take a break. 
M And, what! Let’s the witch continue to cause havoc everywhere!
M Not on my watch.
P Why are you obsessed with the witch anyway?
M I’M NOT OBSESSED! The witch is a monstrosity that needs to be vanquished!
P But, aren’t you like a monster? Isn’t she like your mother?

P … I guess you have a point.
M Of course, I do. Now, let’s go.
P Ah, okay.
