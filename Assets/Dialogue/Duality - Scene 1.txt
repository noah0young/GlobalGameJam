P W-Where am I? 
M Did I win? 
P Did I… defeat that witch? 
M I must have, but I don’t have… 
P her… 
M head. 
P Damn—
M DAMNIT!
P Who was that? Where do you come from?
M WHO AM I? 
M Here’s a more important question: WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? 
M Oh, that’s right. You’re the fool who made me lose to that rotten damned witch.
P …
P Seriously?
M SERIOUSLY!
P Oh, sorry about that. 
P To be frank, I don’t know what I did, but I do sincerely apologize.
M UGH! Forget you!
M Now, where the hell am I? And… w-why can’t I move?
P Oh yeah, I can’t see you anywhere, but I can hear you loud and clear in my noggin. You’re blaring up quite the storm up there.
M WHAT!
M UGH! That witch must’ve done something to me.
P To us.
M Shut the hell up!
M Did she merge our bodies? Our minds?
P Or something.
M Why are you so calm about this!!
M Oi, are you involved?!
P What, no! 
P Or, I don’t think so. I honestly don’t remember much after the fall.
M You’re so useless.
P Says the one can’t even move properly.
M … 
M Shut the hell up.
P But, look at me. I can move wherever I want! 
P Huh, what just happened?
M Alright! I’m in control now!
M But,,,
P You can’t even jump, huh. 
M Shut up. But I can fight at least! And, that’s good enough for me!
P Um, so it seems that… well, you can’t move around without me. And, I can’t fight without you. So…
P Let’s team up! We can find the witch together and demand her to split us up!
M I rather die here then working with you.
P Oh okay then. 
M …
P …
M …
P …
M Fine! Let’s get this over with. 
P Okay!
